 * 
 * Potential implementation approaches:
 * 
 * 1. Browser-based ML using TensorFlow.js:
 *    - Load a pre-trained model for signature verification
 *    - Process image data in the browser
 *    - Extract features and compare with reference signatures
 * 
 * 2. Server-based ML (Python backend):
 *    - Send image to a backend API (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
 *    - Process with Python ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
 *    - Use computer vision techniques (OpenCV) for image preprocessing
 *    - Apply techniques like Siamese networks for signature comparison
 *    - Return results to the frontend
 * 
 * Key techniques for signature verification:
 * - Feature extraction from signature images
 * - Pattern recognition in stroke patterns
 * - Comparison with known reference signatures
 * - Analysis of writing pressure, stroke speed, and consistency
